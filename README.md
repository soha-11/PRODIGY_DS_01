I have completed my task-1 given to me during the internship period as a Data Science intern with Prodigy InfoTech.
TASK_01: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
During this experience, I had the opportunity to analyze and interpret data about the bar chart and histogram, it is a graphical representation of the distribution of data points in a dataset.
